                A program designed to integrate years of advanced study by USC students, as they apply what they have learned 
                to the problems of organizations in the community. The project begins with students making project selections in 
                November. The course runs through mid-April. During this time, the student teams devote a total of approximately 
                200 hours conducting research and analysis in order to research a problem facing the host company. Each team 
                is supervised by experienced USC faculties and closely mentored by a faculty appointed teaching assistant. 
                The teams consist of 1-2 teams per project with 4-6 students per team. The project culminates in a detailed written 
                analysis with action recommendations.
