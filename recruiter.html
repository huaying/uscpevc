            Field Application Projects
        </h3>
        <p>
            A program designed to integrate years of advanced study by USC students, as they apply what they have learned 
            to the problems of organizations in the community. The project begins with students making project selections in 
            November. The course runs through mid-April. During this time, the student teams devote a total of approximately 
            200 hours conducting research and analysis in order to research a problem facing the host company. Each team 
            is supervised by experienced USC faculties and closely mentored by a faculty appointed teaching assistant. 
            The teams consist of 1-2 teams per project with 4-6 students per team. The project culminates in a detailed written 
            analysis with action recommendations.
